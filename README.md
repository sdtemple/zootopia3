This repository follows a workshop to set up a Python package, build some neural networks with `torch`, and publish the models on HuggingFace. 

There are two datasets that we simulate:
1. Colored shapes (circle, rectangle, triangle, diamond) in a pixellated image
2. One-dimensional sinusoids

Alongside these datasets, we fit the following model objectives:
1. (Classification) Predict the shape and color in the image
2. (Regression) Predict the next time steps of the sine function

## Usage

Learn how to train neural networks from scratch.

1. Run `answers/simulate-exercise.ipynb` to get data.
2. Fill in the ` # TO DO ` parts in `examples/modeling-exercise-*.ipynb`. 
3. Compare to solutions in `answers/modeling-exercise-*.ipynb`.
4. You can explore different parameters on big models with `scripts/modeling.py`.
    - Write a shell script that invokes `scripts/modeling.py` and pass args to `slurm`.
5. Run `scripts/modeling-final.py` for best model choice (train + val data).
6. (Optional) Compare to the benchmark [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sdtemple/colored-shapes).

The package defined under `src/` provides:
- A class `Shape` that instantiates an image with 1 colored shape
- A function `simulate_shapes()` to make many images for an image classifier
- A model class `MyCNN` to fit a standard architecture

Caution: you may need GPU resources if your models or data are large.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+

## Install

If you want to install the package only from the internet:

```
pip install zootopia3
```

If you want to set up an isolated environment and build locally:

```
python -m venv path-to/your-environment
source path-to/your-environment/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

You run the `pip` command within this repo.

## Data

I made a training and validation set with:
- 2000 samples for each combo
- `mix_x = 20`
- `max_x = 100`
- `shades = True`
- `magnitude = 50`

I made a testing set with:
- 20 samples for each combo
- `min_x = 10`
- `max_x = 50`

Therefore, the test set is a more difficult prediction problem.

You can find the test data [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sdtemple/colored-shapes).

## Sharing your work

To upload your model to Hugging Face, run these short scripts.
```
python hf-push.py your-model.pth sdtemple/color-prediction-model
```

A less elegant solution where you have to manually write the `config.json` data is:
```
python scripts/hf-convert.py your-model.pt your-model.safetensors
python scripts/hf-model.py your-model.safetensors sdtemple/color-prediction-model
```

To upload your data to Hugging Face, run this script.
```
python scripts/hf-dataset.py images.npy target_color.txt target_shape.txt your-username/colored-shapes
```

If you successfully uploaded a pretrained model to Hugging Face, you can run it on a CPU with `answers/inference-exercise.ipynb`.

## Test

You can run the test scripts in `tests/` with the following:

```
python -m pytest
```
